# ts-binds
ts-binds binds two different folders on your device so that both folders share the same contents

## What does it do
Derived from a very long-living trick for users who are struggling with the internal storage space available on their phones, while at the same time has the benefit of inserting an SD card, ts-binds will make use of already available functions on your device, to mirror a path to another path, effectively making both paths indistinguishable.

For example, if you mirror the `Download` folder on Internal with the `Stuff from Internet` folder on your SD Card, the same list of cat pictures will be shown on both directories when navigated via a file manager, and any changes will take effect on both paths.

## Notice
Using this module will disable sdcardfs.
