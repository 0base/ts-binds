#| SYNTAX:
#|   folderbind <Bind/couple name> $sd<SD path> $int<Internal path>
#|
#| If an argument contains spaces, quotes are REQUIRED to ensure the script to run properly. All three arguments are REQUIRED
#|
#| The hash symbol (hashtag) is a comment character - everything after it will not be processed by the shell. The hash symbol at the start of a line will prevent the folder couple from being processed by ts-binds. The example below won't be processed by the shell until you remove the hash symbol.
